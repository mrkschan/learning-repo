# How to Build #

Ant 1.7+ is required to build the deployment .war. The build process need a proper configuration of j2ee server. Modify the file build.properties and change the j2ee.server.path according to your environment.

    build.properties:
    j2ee.server.path=<path_to_j2ee_server>

Run the following Ant task to build the .war:

    $> ant dist

# Developer Notes #

If you find netbeans is blaming syntax error of missing javax.servlet, simply modify and add the line below to nbproject/private/private.properties

    j2ee.server.path=<path_to_j2ee_server>

Remember to place the appropriate path to <path_to_j2ee_server>
